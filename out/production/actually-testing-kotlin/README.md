# Actually Testing Kotlin!

Now i'm gradually learning how Android Studio works. Guess i'm overcoming my noob programming fears... ðŸ¥º

## What i made this for:
Simply put, a way for me to study the programming language Kotlin, mainly used for mobile apps, both 
with individual files which will be Terminal-run only, and possibly small projects with interfaces and
all of that.

Maybe this readme will have something interesting in the future? Who knows...
